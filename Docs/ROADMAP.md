# Ollama Completions for SQL Server - Roadmap

## Functions to consider for implementation

### AskAllModels Function
- **Description:** Sends a prompt to all available hosted models and returns their responses in a table format.
- **Usage:** Compare outputs, perform ensemble analysis, or select the best response.
- **Output Structure:** A table with columns like `ModelName`, `Response`, `ConfidenceScore`, and `Metadata`.

### SummarizeText Function
- **Description:** Summarizes large text inputs into concise summaries.
- **Usage:** Ideal for summarizing lengthy documents such as logs, reports, or articles.

### ClassifyText Function
- **Description:** Classifies text data into predefined categories using an LLM.
- **Usage:** Useful for tagging content, sentiment analysis, or organizing unstructured text.

### TranslateText Function
- **Description:** Translates text between languages using an LLM.
- **Usage:** Ideal for applications requiring multilingual data accessibility.

### ExplainQueryPlan Function
- **Description:** Generates a human-readable explanation of SQL query execution plans.
- **Usage:** Helps developers and DBAs optimize complex query plans.

### GenerateInsights Function
- **Description:** Analyzes data patterns and provides insights or recommendations.
- **Usage:** Can assist with business intelligence, trend analysis, or anomaly detection.

### ExtractEntities Function
- **Description:** Extracts structured entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) from unstructured text.

## Development Tasks

### New Features

- **AskAllModels**
  - What would the TVF fill-row schema for this feaure look like?
  - Would this query be too slow? GPU context has to be dumped and recreated when models are switched.
  - Would ability to specify a subset list of models be useful?

  - **JSON requests and replies**
  - Can models be asked to frame their replies in JSON (aside from the API response)?
  - How are agents, roles and tools specified to models?
  - How are tools actions requested by the model to be handled?

---

### Improvements and maintenance

- **Ollama context field deprecated**: With Ollama 0.5.4 (Dec 2024), the context field in 
requests has been deprecated. Currently, the `CompleteMultiplePrompts` function
depends on the context array to link iterated queries. How would this scheme
work going forward?

---

### Testing and documentation

- Service helper classes need unit tests.
- Explore "diagrams as code" to visualize system interactions.

This roadmap outlines the planned features and tasks required to enhance the functionality, usability, 
and documentation of `Ollama Completions for SQL Server`. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help 
prioritize and implement these updates.
