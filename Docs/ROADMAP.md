# Ollama Completions for SQL Server - Roadmap

## Functions to consider for implementation

### AskAllModels Function
- **Description:** Sends a prompt to all available hosted models and returns their responses in a table format.
- **Usage:** Compare outputs, perform ensemble analysis, or select the best response.
- **Output Structure:** A table with columns like `ModelName`, `Response`, `ConfidenceScore`, and `Metadata`.

### SummarizeText Function
- **Description:** Summarizes large text inputs into concise summaries.
- **Usage:** Ideal for summarizing lengthy documents such as logs, reports, or articles.

### ClassifyText Function
- **Description:** Classifies text data into predefined categories using an LLM.
- **Usage:** Useful for tagging content, sentiment analysis, or organizing unstructured text.

### GenerateSQLQuery Function
- **Description:** Converts natural language questions into SQL queries.
- **Usage:** Enables users to write queries in plain English, translated into SQL commands.

### TranslateText Function
- **Description:** Translates text between languages using an LLM.
- **Usage:** Ideal for applications requiring multilingual data accessibility.

### ExplainQueryPlan Function
- **Description:** Generates a human-readable explanation of SQL query execution plans.
- **Usage:** Helps developers and DBAs optimize complex query plans.

### GenerateInsights Function
- **Description:** Analyzes data patterns and provides insights or recommendations.
- **Usage:** Can assist with business intelligence, trend analysis, or anomaly detection.

### ExtractEntities Function
- **Description:** Extracts structured entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) from unstructured text.
- **Usage:** Useful for populating relational tables from text fields.

### ChatWithData Function
- **Description:** Enables conversational interaction with data, returning answers generated by an LLM.
- **Usage:** Improves data exploration for non-technical users.

## Development Tasks

### New Features
- **QueryFromPrompt Function**:
  - Implement execution of arbitrary database queries via SQL/CLR.
  - Would a database schema help the LLM? Can the LLM read structured (ie JSON) schema?
  - How do I keep an LLM focused on producing valid SQL queries?
  - Look at ganged or staged model queries to get from natural language to SQL code.

- **AskAllModels**
  - What would the TVF fill-row schema look like?
  - Would this query be too slow?

---

### Testing
  - QueryFromPrompt will require integration testing

---

### Documentation
- Explore "diagrams as code" to visualize system interactions.
- Explore linked Markdown files.
